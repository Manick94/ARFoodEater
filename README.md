# AR Food Eater
A small AR game prototype of how to use face tracking blend shapes and head position to help in determining collisions between mouth and food falling from the sky. 

Watch my step by step [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Nfct3FewA3c) showing how this works. Subscribe if possible to help me in making more videos and code like this thanks.
